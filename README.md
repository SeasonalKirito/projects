If you have any issues, or notice piece of code missing within the repository please message SEASONAL#1235 on Discord or leave a message here.

Some Projects may not function properly if the owner removed the source or updated and broke functions within the Code.
If you get a HTTP 404 it probably means the owner removed source-code message me if this occurs.
